# Coalescent simulations

This repository containes all of the codes needed to recreate simulations conducted in Masters diploma thesis "Coalescent models for estimating phylogenetic trees" by Krzysztof Banecki, thesis supervisor prof. Grzegorz Rempa≈Ça.

All of the functions are kept in the `estimation_functions.py` and `tree_functions.py`. Basic applications are presented in `.ipynb` notebooks.
